================================================================================
RULE ENGINE LOGIC
================================================================================

The system implements 9 explicit if-then rules:

Rule 1: First Attempt
  IF: student has no attempts
  THEN: show EASY question
  REASON: Start with warm-up

Rule 2: Consecutive Failures
  IF: 3+ consecutive incorrect answers
  THEN: show LESSON
  REASON: Student needs concept review

Rule 3: Low Topic Accuracy
  IF: topic accuracy < 50% (and ≥3 attempts)
  THEN: show FEEDBACK
  REASON: Topic understanding is weak

Rule 4: Recent Performance Decline
  IF: recent accuracy < 50% AND overall accuracy ≥ 75%
  THEN: show FEEDBACK
  REASON: Recent struggle needs attention

Rule 5: Easy Mastery
  IF: easy accuracy ≥ 90%
  THEN: show MEDIUM question
  REASON: Ready for harder material

Rule 6: Medium Mastery
  IF: medium accuracy ≥ 90%
  THEN: show HARD question
  REASON: Ready for challenges

Rule 7: Hard Struggles
  IF: hard accuracy < 50%
  THEN: show MEDIUM question
  REASON: Need to build confidence

Rule 8: Good Performance
  IF: overall accuracy ≥ 75%
  THEN: continue at same difficulty
  REASON: Maintain good pace

Rule 9: Default Adaptive
  DEFAULT: determine difficulty from accuracy
  THEN: appropriate difficulty question
  REASON: Personalized difficulty

================================================================================
LABELED DATA STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Each StudentAttempt captures:
- question_id: str (which question)
- student_answer: str (what they answered)
- is_correct: bool (LABEL: correctness)
- timestamp: datetime (when answered)
- time_taken_seconds: int (how long)
- topic: str (LABEL: subject area)
- difficulty: DifficultyLevel (LABEL: EASY/MEDIUM/HARD)

This labeled data enables:
✓ Supervised learning approach
✓ Performance tracking by topic
✓ Performance tracking by difficulty
✓ Trend analysis (improving/declining)
✓ Rule-based decision making

================================================================================
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

Layer 1: DATA MODELS (models.py)

Layer 2: ANALYSIS (analyzer.py)
  - Processes answers
  - Tracks labeled data
  - Calculates metrics

Layer 3: DECISION ENGINE (rule_engine.py)
  - Applies if-then rules
  - Determines next action
  ↓
Layer 4: INTEGRATION (system.py)
  - Combines analyzer + rules
  - Public API interface

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES
================================================================================

Potential Extensions (not required, but possible):
1. Add more question types (multiple choice, fill-in-blank, etc.)
2. Implement machine learning model to optimize rule thresholds
3. Add visualization dashboard for performance tracking
4. Support for collaborative learning (peer comparisons)
5. Integration with learning management systems (LMS)
6. Real-time progress notifications
7. Gamification elements (badges, points, streaks)
8. Export performance reports (PDF, CSV)

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for any of these
enhancements while meeting all stated requirements.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

✅ All requirements successfully implemented
✅ Rule-based supervised system working as specified
✅ Labeled data tracking and analysis complete
✅ Decision logic for questions/lessons/feedback operational
✅ Comprehensive testing and documentation provided
✅ Production-ready code with zero dependencies
✅ Ready for deployment and use

The system successfully analyzes student answers and performance, then decides
what to show next (questions, lessons, or feedback) using explicit if-then
rules and labeled data, exactly as requested.
